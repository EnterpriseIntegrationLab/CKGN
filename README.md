# City Knowledge Graph Network (CKGN)

The purpose of this repository is to provide a space where CKGN members can share content on relevant work to foster both reuse and sharing of information.
The structure of the repository is currently divided by organization, with the suggested standard set of main content sections for each:
* Ontologies
* Use Cases
* Published Papers and Technical Reports
* Other

Below is a listing of key information about the CKGN members and their projects.
