# City Knowledge Graph Network (CKGN)

The purpose of this repository is to provide a space where CKGN members can share content on relevant work to foster both reuse and sharing of information.
The structure of the repository is currently divided by organization, with the suggested standard set of main content sections for each:
* Ontologies
* Use Cases
* Published Papers and Technical Reports
* Other

Below is a listing of key information about the CKGN members and their projects.

### Projects
#### Canadian Census Ontology
The University of Torontoâ€™s Urban Data Centre Canadian Census Ontology project aims to develop an ontology for representing Canadian Census data and census data in general. It builds on existing city data standards such as ISO/IEC 21972:2020, ISO/IEC 5087-1, and ISO/IEC 5087-2, and conforms to Linked Data requirements.  The goal of this project is to achieve semantic interoperability of census data by defining a semantically precise census ontology that is implemented as Linked Data, making it machine interpretable. The Census ontology enables the integration of data from multiple sources, opening up new possibilities for the development of data analysis and visualization tools.

The Canadian Census Ontology files can be found under UniversityOfToronto/Census/Ontologies.  This folder contains 2 OWL files:
* CACensus2.owl - This OWL file contains the key classes and properties of the Canadian Census Ontology.
* Toronto.owl - This OWL file contains classes and properties for representing the various administrative areas in the City of Toronto (e.g. wards, neighbourhoods)
